Responsive Portfolio

This is an initial take on my personal portfolio. It's an assignment from the Coding Bootcamp I cam currently undertaking. The portfolio utilizes Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a responsive design that is coded to work on desktop size screens as well as smaller mobile devices. 

Main components of the project are a consistent nav bar with links to further pages of my portfolio, when the page is in viewed in a small screen the links shrink down to a hamburger menu in the left corner that then functions as a drop down menu containing said links.

The layout and images are responsive when moving from desktop view to mobile view using bootstraps grid system and minimal media queries for styling.
